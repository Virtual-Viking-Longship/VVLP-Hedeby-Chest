# VVLP-Hedeby-Chest
A simple VR experience surrounding the Hedeby chest for the Team VR Projects

As of 6-22-2023 several objects are stand in models created in Unity as placeholders for proof of concept
- bedroll based off experimental archaeology bedroll from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBMD6dAMMro&ab_channel=HandsOnHistory
- comb based off images from http://sol.sydvestjyskemuseer.dk/?mode=thumbnail&antal=1000&search=kam

We have plans to add additional objects based on further research into what Vikings would carry. Potential objects include clothing, loot, and goods meant to be traded.
