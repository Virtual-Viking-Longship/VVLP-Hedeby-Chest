# VVLP-Hedeby-Chest
A simple VR experience surrounding the Hedeby chest for the Team VR Projects

Several objects are stand in models created in Unity as placeholders for proof of concept
- bedroll based off experimental archaeology bedroll from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBMD6dAMMro&ab_channel=HandsOnHistory
- coin purse based off images from https://wiki.vikingsonline.org.uk/Pouches

We have plans to add additional objects based on further research into what Vikings would carry. Potential objects include clothing, loot, and goods meant to be traded.
